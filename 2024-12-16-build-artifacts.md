# Build Artifacts

> **Artifact**: an object made or modified by a human being, typically one of cultural or historical interest

I think you should make more artifacts.

If you care about your ideas being spread and remembered, you should build artifacts. Artifacts allow you to outsource your memory to something more durable, and often more accessible.

Artifacts can be essays, videos, photos, documents, calendar events, or web pages! The most key thing about a good artifact is that it is durable and can be easily found later. If it can be made accessible over the internet, all the better!

Any idea that spreads successfully depends on artifacts directly, in essentially all cases I can think of.

How are governments built and maintained? Written laws, declarations, treaties, court decisions, and so on.

The internet maintains itself through a series of standards defined in RFCs.

I needn't give much explanation for how academia shares and remembers ideas.

When rulers wish to destroy or cripple the spread of ideas, naturally they start by destroying the artifacts! Likewise if you wish to _promote_ the spread of ideas, you should create them.

At work, this strategy can take many forms:
- When releasing features, create a video or blog post somewhere. When people have questions about how the feature works, you now have a starting point to direct them to!
- When planning a big project, document your plan somewhere accessible for others to read and critique.
- When reaching a conclusion on a time-consuming or otherwise important decision, record that decision to a Decision Log. This can help short-circuit a repeat conversation over the same discussion points.
- When working on a team that must collectively stay abreast of important dates and deadlines, create some kind of shared calendar to maintain alignment and avoid surprises.
- When you discover that you or a teammate has a workflow which is superior to what others are doing, find a way to document it and broadcast it to the team!
- And of course, whenever you find yourself in a meeting where you care about remembering what happened, make sure someone takes notes and shares them afterwards!

I feel this idea is bigger than just the words I have recorded here, but I'm not sure I can do it justice. At least not today.â€¨â€¨In any case, my idea is here, and if you find yourself reading and resonating, maybe you will expand on it with an artifact of your own. ðŸ™‚
